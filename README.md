This repository contains the code of the final project for the course [Natural Language Processing](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~joberant/teaching/nlp_fall_2019_2020/index.html) by [Jonathan Berant](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~joberant/).

##### Installation instructions:
    # $ conda create --name nlp_project --file nlp_project_env.txt

##### How to train the model:
    # $ python3 ./train.py

This work was base on [BREAK It Down: A Question Understanding Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.11770v1.pdf), 
and was trained using the dataset described in this paper, which you may find [here](https://allenai.github.io/Break/).

You may find  previous versions which use BLEU here: [link](https://github.com/amirmatz/DQN/tags)
